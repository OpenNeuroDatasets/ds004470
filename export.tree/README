The Stereotactic Neurosurgery (SNSX) dataset currently consists of 32 healthy participants (46.2 ± 13.5 years; median: 48 years; range: 20–70 years; 12 female and 20 male; right-handed).

Imaging: 
7-T head-only scanner (Siemens Magnetom; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) at the Western University Centre for Functional and Metabolic Mapping (CFMM). An 8-channel parallel transmit/32-receive channel coil was used.

We also release anatomical fiducial (AFIDs) placements on this local dataset. AFIDs placements were performed using 3DSlicer version 4.10.0 on structural T1w images and was performed a total of 3 times on all subject scans (3,072 fiducials).

Ethics: 
Release of this dataset was approved by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (R-17-156). All subjects signed a written consent form to participate.
